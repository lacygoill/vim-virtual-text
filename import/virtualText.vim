# TODO: Truncate the virtual  text so that it doesn't overflow  beyond the right
# border of a window.  Use `popup_settext()` to reset the text.

# TODO: We should be able to use different highlight groups for different chunks
# of the virtual text.  This would be useful, for example, to highlight a prefix
# in a different color.

# TODO: Implement `VirtualTextClear()`{{{
#
# To remove  arbitrary virtual  texts, inside  arbitrary range  of lines,  in an
# arbitrary buffer.
#
# Signature:
#
#     # consider putting all arguments into a single dictionary
#     VirtualTextClear(
#         buffer: number,  # buffer handle, or 0 for current buffer
#         ns_id: number,   # namespace to clear, or -1 to clear all namespaces
#         lnum1: number    # start of range of lines to clear
#         lnum2: number    # end of range of lines to clear
#         )
#
# About the `ns_id` argument: it will require some refactoring.
# We'll need `VirtualTextAdd()` to map a virtual text to an arbitrary namespace.
# The db will also need to be refactored to include the namespace info.
#
# ---
#
# We should remove the listener if we remove all virtual texts from a buffer.
#}}}

# TODO: We should be able to *only* pass a line number and some text to `VirtualTextAdd()`.
# In such a case, the function should not tie the virtual text to any real text.
# It should stay visible on the line as long as the latter is not removed.

# TODO: We  need to  use this  feature as  frequently as  possible, to  test and
# improve its reliability.  Any idea how we would use it?
# Suggestion: Supercharge the `m` command so that when  we set a mark on a line,
# its name is appended at the end of the line.
# Also, `ma` could simply use the text  `a`, while `m CTRL-a` could ask the user
# for a short annotation which would be appended after the mark's name.

# FIXME: Doesn't work well when joining lines with virtual texts.{{{
#
# Example: Delete the first  3 lines (the ones which don't  have virtual texts),
# then join the  new first 2 lines  (the one which do have  virtual texts), then
# undo, and finally append  text on the first line: the  inserted text is hidden
# behind the popup.
#
# Update: Actually, can  repro just by  deleting the third line,  then appending
# text on the new 3rd line.
#}}}
# FIXME: Doesn't work well when cutting lines.{{{
#
# Example: Press `cj` while on the "shattered" line:
#
#     Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
#     And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
#
# The second virtual text is correctly removed, but not the first one.
# This trailing text remains:
#
#     en into many pieces
#
# It's a Vim bug, and I don't think there is much we can do to fix it on our side.
# Although, you  could install a  custom mapping  which would clear  a remaining
# virtual text on-demand.   But note that in  that case, if you  undo, you won't
# recover it.
#}}}

# Init {{{1

# What does this db do?{{{
#
# It maps a buffer number to arbitrary  virtual texts, as well as a counter, and
# a list of window IDs.
#
# The counter is necessary to generate unique property type names.
# It's incremented every time a virtual text is added into to the buffer.
# It's *never* decremented; even if a virtual text is later removed.
#
# The list  of window IDs  match the windows where  the buffer is  displayed and
# where the popups have been created.
#
# A virtual text is stored as a  dictionary mapping a text property type name to
# various information which we need when we want to:
#
#    - reload the buffer
#
#    - "mirror" the virtual text in all windows displaying the buffer
#
#    - update the padding between the left border of the popup and its text,
#      because some text has been inserted/deleted
#
# Regarding the first bullet point, remember that Vim automatically removes text
# properties when a buffer is reloaded,  if they're local to this buffer.  Which
# in turn  causes popups attached to  text properties to lose  their `textprop*`
# options.  This needs to be fixed for virtual texts to persist across reloads.
